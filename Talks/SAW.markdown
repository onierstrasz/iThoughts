* show some google images!  
* Problems w SA  
    * not just bubble and arrow diagrams  
    * not just dependencies

        * no collaboration  
        * no tooling  
    * Architecture is not enough  
        * not manifested in code  
        * many kinds  
            * not just dependencies  
        * poor tool support  
        * mismatch between code and run time  
* survey

    * CS case study  
    * glamour

## ASA Research tracks  
  
* Agile modeling  
    * Many kinds of data

            * heterogeneous  
        * versions  
        * bugs reports  
        * requirements

    * it's mainly about user needs  
    * constraints to ensure NF reqts  
* the system is not just source code  
    * many kinds of information  
    * need to model and analyze  
* we are missing the right tools  
    * need meta-tooling environment  
  
## MISC JUNK  
  
* Setup  
    * Problem  
        * how to make informed decisions?

        * with high quality  
    * does not address developer needs  
* Lots of Data  
    * how to analyze?  
    * How to get from data to models?  
        * queryable  
        * analyzable
