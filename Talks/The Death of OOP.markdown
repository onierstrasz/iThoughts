# The Death of OOP  
  
FASE 2016  
  
## The trouble with OOP  
  
* Gap between models and code  
* Developers spend more time reading than writing code  
    * IDEs are glorified text editors  
* Software inevitably changes  
    * But PLs do not support it  
* Programming is modeling  
  
## Bring models closer to code  
  
* OOP = "Design your own paradigm"  
* We should view OOPs as modeling languages  
    * Queryable model  
    * Manipulable model  
    * Technical and application domains  
* Eg Helvetia  
    Progress: 100%  
  
* Eg Moose !  
    * Open issue: still need to import models from code; how to eliminate this barrier?  
        * models = code  
  
## Exploit domain models in the IDE  
  
* Moldable tools  
    * Moldable debugger  
    * Moldable inspector  
* Open issue: enhance IDE with domain-specific information  
    * domain-aware IDEs  
  
## Link code to the Ecosystem  
  
* Live programming  
* Ecosystem mining  
* Evolutionary monitoring  
    * Eg Dicto  
* Open issue: link the code and the running application to the environment  
    * link code to living environment  
  
## Conclusion  
  
* Breathe new life into OOP  
* models = code  
* domain-aware IDEs  
* link code to environment
