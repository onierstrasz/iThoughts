IWRE talk, Kanpur 2012-02-22  
  
## Talk outline  
  
* Motivation  
    * Much development time is spent trying to understand code  
    * Architecture is lost  
    * Relationships and dependencies are implicit  
    * Links between artifacts are missing  
    * IDE focuses on programming tasks, not understanding!  
    * Need better tools  
        * Need better tools for building better tools!  
* MOOSE  
    * Extensible meta-model  
        * Navigation, groping, metrics etc  
    * System complexity  
    * Overview of tools  
  
## Themes / lessons  
  
* Investment in infrastructure  
* Extensible metamodel  
* Smalltalk  
    * moving fast with a dynamic system  
    * no split between run time and compile time  
* Moving fast to build tools  
    * Not closed tools, but tools to build tools  
* From black-box framework to internal DSL  
    * Mondrian & Glamour
