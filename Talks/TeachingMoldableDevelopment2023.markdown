## MD Best Practice Patterns  
  
cf Kent Beck's book  
  
* Learn to find stuff  
      
    Maybe a set of patterns?  
  
* From Test First to Example First  
* Design screenshots to tell a story  
* Start from a Lepiter page  
* Moldable views  
    * Inspector  
    * Debugger  
    * Spotter  
* Replace navigation by view  
* Adjacent views  
    * Building views so you can explore a list next to the exploration view / analysis  
* Prototype new behavior in an Inspector playground  
  
## Onboarding Patterns  
  
* Mentoring  
    * Pairing  
  
## Other patterns  
  
* The Debugger is Your Friend  
    * The Inspector is Your Friend  
  
## Obstacles  
  
* GT is the first thing you see  
* GT is not as good as my hammer
