# Identify the Champion, Revisited  
  
## Patterns  
  
* Identify the Champion  
    * In practice, a paper is accepted only if it has a "champion"  
        * So focus the review process on identifying the champion  
* Experts Review Papers  
    * Make sure reviewers (PC members) have the expertise to defend papers  
* Champions Review Papers  
    * Use a bidding process to increase the chances a paper will have a champion  
* Make Champions Explicit  
    * This is the most important information on the review form  
        * Expertise is the second most important piece of information  
    * Aside from the review itself, everything else is fluff  
* Identify the Conflicts  
    * Group papers according to their highest and lowest scores  
        * yields interesting categories of papers  
        * Eg AB, BC, AD ...  
* Identify Missing Champions  
    * Ie for physical PC meetings!  
* Champions Speak First  
    * Start on a positive note  
* Consensus on PC Papers
