# Compositional programming  
  
Dagstuhl 12511 tutorial, Dec 2012  
  
## Early history  
  
* paradigm: procedural composition  
    * motivation: code reuse, managing complexity  
* subroutines (David Wheeler, 1949)  
    * repeatedly invoke common code sequences  
* libraries (FORTRAN, 1955)  
    * huge libraries led to long-live success of FORTRAN  
* recursion (ALGOL, 1958)  
    * initially a hack; turned out to be essential for abstraction  
    * reentrant procedures  
* modules (COBOL, 1959)  
    * enabled stepwise decomposition of large systems  
  
## OOP  
  
* paradigm: object composition + incremental refinement  
    * motivation: domain modeling  
* ADTs  
    * encapsulation  
        * P2 slides  
    * abstraction  
    * information hiding  
* Simula vs Smalltalk  
    * OOP as an add-on  
        * C++  
        * Objective C  
    * motivated by simulation  
    * objects  
        * classes  
        * inheritance  
* Smalltalk  
    * motivated by modeling and engineering concerns  
    * "pure" OO  
* principles  
    * open/closed principle  
        * modules are closed for modification  
        * open for extensiom  
    * substitutability principle  
        * Wegner & Zdonik  
            * incremental reuse  
        * Liskov & Wing  
    * design by contract  
        * pre- and post-conditions  
        * class invariants  
    * other SOLID principles?  
* white box frameworks  
    * hollywood principle  
        * reverse usual control  
    * subclassing contract often implicit  
        * hard to learn and adapt  
* patterns  
  
## Components  
  
* paradigm: configuration of interacting components  
    * manage variation  
* software product lines  
    * domain specific framework for producing a range of related applications  
    * key concern: managing variation  
    * can use a range of techniques  
* components  
    * independent unit of deployment  
        * Szyperski definition  
    * black box frameworks  
        * emphasize composition, not refinement  
* scripting  
    * applications = components + scripts (+ glue)  
    * DSLs  
        * external  
            * special language  
        * internal  
            * API + idiomatic use of host language  
    * Piccola  
        * 1 slide summary?  
* plugin architectures  
    * cf wikipedia article  
        Link: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)][1]  
  
* SOA  
    Link: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture][2]  
  
    * web-based composition of services  
        * stateless services  
    * supports distribution and integration  
    * throwback to library-based approaches?  
  
## Features  
  
* paradigm: model and compose elementary features  
    * features represent domain concepts  
* Mixins  
    * Flavors  
    * "abstract subclass"  
    * encapsulate reusable methods and state  
    * sensitive to composition order  
        * determines conflict resolution  
        * source of fragility  
* Traits  
    * insensitive to composition order  
        * explicit aliasing and exclusion  
    * purely static  
        * can be flattened away  
    * Talents  
        * dynamic traits for individual objects  
* FOP/FOSD  
    Link: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-oriented_programming][3]  
  
    * transformations add features to base programs  
* Generative programming  
    Link: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_programming#Generative_programming][4]  
  
    * template metaprogramming  
        Link: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_meta-programming][5]  
  
* Subject Oriented Programming  
    Link: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-oriented_programming][6]  
  
    * multi-dimensional separation of concerns  
    * like COP, but context is the subject  
* COP  
    * adaptations defined in layers  
    * layers applied when context is triggered  
  
## Fine-grained adaptation  
  
* paradigm: composition is metaprogrammng  
    * separate base and meta-levels  
* reflection  
    * reflection vs reification  
    * introspection vs intercession  
    * structural vs behavioural  
    * MOPs vs metaobjects vs tower of interpreters  
* AOP  
    * factor out cross-cutting concerns  
    * pointcuts apply aspects to joinpoints in code  
        * joinpoints may be static or dynamic  
        * AspectJ  
* Dependency injection  
    * externalize dependencies  
    * mechanisms  
        * parameterization  
        * code generation  
        * reflection  
            * bytecode adaptation  
    * example: injecting mocks for testing  
* MDD  
    * Models are instances of meta-models  
        * Stop with M3 (meta-meta-models)  
    * practical application in UML  
    * Generate platform-specific applications from platform-independent models  
        * use model transformations between levels
