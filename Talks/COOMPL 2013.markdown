## modeling vs programming  
  
* Problems  
    * gap between model (domain) and code  
        * features vs code?  
        * architecture vs code?  
    * synchronization  
        * UML  
            * bubble and arrows don't crash  
    * limited applicability of MDE  
* OOPLs are modeling languages  
    * build your own paradigm  
    * MM = DSL = API  
* Missing Domain-aware tools  
    * Doodledebug  
    * Moldable debugger  
    * Object-centric debugger  
    * Helvetia  
* Challenges  
    * need support for multiple views  
    * visual DSLs  
    * domain aware tools  
  
## IDEs  
  
* Problems  
    * Developers spend more time reading code than writing  
        * but they don't support reading well  
    * IDEs are code-centric  
    * Disconnect between code and run-time  
        * static and runtime  
        * where is this feature?  
    * Disconnect between objects and classes  
* Hermion  
    * Senseo  
* Morphic halos  
    * Self  
    * Squeak  
    * Seaside  
* Challenges  
    * better integration IDE and runtime  
    * live programming  
  
## Architecture  
  
* Problems  
    * Architecture is not in the code  
    * limited support for many architectural constraints  
    * hard to know impact of changes  
* architecture survey  
* Analysis tools  
    * Moose  
    * Mondrian  
* Challenges  
    * architectural monitoring  
    * expressing NFRs in code  
        * pluggable types  
        * annotations  
  
## Supporting evolution  
  
* Problems  
    * Most PL mechanisms impede evolution rather than support it  
    * hard to evolve application at run time  
* Changeboxes  
* Active Context  
* debuggers  
    * Object Flow debugger  
* Traits  
    * Talents  
* Challenges  
    * better support for context  
    * live refactoring  
        * migrating running systems  
  
## Epilogue  
  
* modeling ecosystems and beyond  
    * big data  
    * active recommendations
