            For example ./Help  
  
    * To follow the link PRESS on the topic with the link  
        * A PRESS is longer than a tap but shorter than a long press...!?

    * After jumping to a link, press the back button to return to the original map (the map picker toolbar button will change to a back button automatically)

        * Tap the second topic (and a relationship will be created)  
        * To cancel the operation tap anywhere on the canvas

        * Tap one of the linked topics

## FAQ  
  
* The crosshair - why?  
      
    Tapping on the canvas will present a small 'crosshair' icon - and usually a 'Paste' menu next to it. What does this mean?  
      
    - Select 'paste' to paste the clipboard at that location.  
    - Tap the crosshair itself to move the currently selected topic to that location (can be easier than dragging manually)  
    - Tap one of the create topic toolbar buttons and the new topic will be placed at this location.  
      
    The crosshair can be disabled in the Settings App.

    * Formats  
          
        Unless indicated otherwise, support is for Windows and Mac  
  
        * Freemind 0.8.x / 0.9.x (and Freeplane)  
        * Mindmanager v6 and above  
        * Novamind 4 / 5  
        * XMind  
        * Mindview 3 / 4 (Windows ONLY)  
        * iMindmap v4 and above  
        * ConceptDraw MINDMAP 6 / 7  
        * OPML  
              
            OPML is a relatively standard format for hierarchical information - supported by a number of PC/Mac mindmap applications. It doesn't support advanced topic attributes such as colour and shape.  
  
            * Omni Outliner  
            * Scrivener  
        * MindGenius 3.71  
        * Outlook CSV  
              
            Which is also compatible with many other Task management apps such as ToodleDo  
  
        * Markdown (export only)  
              
            Markdown is a way to format plain text in such a way that it can easily be converted into HTML - see http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/  
  
        * PDF (export only)  
        * PNG (export only)  
              
            iThoughts can also export an associated HTML file which represents an 'image map' of the PNG  
  
    * Caveats?  
        * Not all attributes are supported in all formats.  
              
            Icons, colours, shapes etc.  
              
            Check the website for more details http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/iThoughtsHD/Compatibility.html  
  
        * Unsupported/recognized attributes and data will be discarded.  
              
            This can be a problem when maps are frequently transferred between desktop application and iThoughtsHD - sorry!  
  
* Old versions  
    * Maps are auto-saved and periodically snapshot'd - previous snapshots can be recovered.  
          
        Every 30 seconds, the map is auto-saved.  
          
        Every 5 minutes a snapshot of the map is taken.  
          
        It is possible to recover any of the previous 100 snapshots.  
          
        When a map is overwritten due to import (box.net, Dropbox.com, wifi, email etc.) the previous version is snapshot'd  
          
        To recover a snapshot, create a new map and choose 'Based Upon' and select a previous version of a map.  
  
* Backup  
      
    A backup/archive is created once per day and each time the Send Archive option is selected.   
      
    The archive needs to be copied off the device in order to be effective - you can either email it, upload it to the cloud or drag it off via iTunes. See http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/iThoughtsHD/BackupRestore.html  
  
    * Do NOT rely on iTunes backups - they are overwritten each time - please take the time to backup your daily archive 'off device'  
* Cloud Synchronisation  
      
    This is a complex subject - please see www.ithoughts.co.uk/cloud for more details
