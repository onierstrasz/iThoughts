* 1. Data Visualization  
    * **Vision:** Live environment to explore data visually  
          
        Creating an immersive big data visual exploration environment  
        - How can research data be automatically processed to support exploratory data visualization?   
        - How can we map research questions to suitable data visualizations?  
  
        * Automatically generate visualizations of new and unknown data sources  
        * Offer interactive means to explore data and search  
* 2. Empowering Human-Machine Learning in Medical Imaging Analysis  
    * **Vision:** generate human-understandable explanations of results obtained by machine learning in medicine  
          
        Improving explanatory aspects of machine learning in medicine  
        - How to effectively combine human and machine intelligence that synergistically support each other.  
        - How to improve the explanatory aspects of machine learning in medicine such to improve the adoption and support of these technologies for clinical use.  
  
        * Support health care experts not only in providing recommendations through machine learning, but help them in explaining the results.  
* 3. Online diffusion of ideas and the relation to public opinion  
    * **Vision:** expose how ideas propagate in online media  
          
        Understanding online diffusion of ideas  
        - Description of information diffusion   
        -  Identification of factors that explain different paths of diffusion   
        -  Show how political attitudes impact this information diffusion  
  
        * Is the emphasis on analysis and explanation, or on advice on how to diffuse ideas?  
        * What would the result be? A tool? A methodology?  
* 4. Business Strategies in a Digital World  
    * **Vision:** exploit location information and history to offer better recommendations to users  
          
        Influencing consumer behavior in a digital business world  
        Data Analytics: Analysing social media and social network data to support personalized (real-time) marketing   
        Generate knowledge to extract visited locations and taken paths of users  
          
        How to extract and predict social network / media data of users, their locations and travel paths?  
        How to generate recommendations for consumers?  
        How to protect privacy of users?   
        How to combine data coming from different sources (i.e., social networks, data interfaces, etc.)?  
  
        * Is the benefit for users or mainly for business?  
  
## Digital Knowledge  
  
* 5.Digital Humanities  
    * Improving understanding of cultural heritage through digital technologies  
          
        Improving understanding of cultural heritage through digital technologies  
        How do digital media affect reflection and research in humanities?  
          
        Wie verändern digitale Medien die (geistes)wissenschaftliche Forschung (Zugang zu Quellen, Arbeitstechniken, Reflexion)?   
        Mit welchen Nutzerprofilen arbeiten die Ersteller von digitalen Simulationen?   
        Welche Dynamik besteht in der Interaktion zwischen Produzenten und Nutzern digitaler Erzeugnisse?   
          
        Entwicklung von Methoden und Werkzeugen zur Vermittlung und Produktion von Wissen in den digitalen Medien.  
  
        * What are some concrete examples of possible outcomes? (“Development of methods and tools for the communication and production go knowledge in digital media”)  
* 6. Work and Digitalization  
    * **Vision:** ensure life-long employability in a digital world.  
          
        Describing change of career patterns in a digital world  
        Digitalization affects career choices because some occupations might disappear in the near future while previously unknown new occupations will emerge.   
          
        Existing research did not specifically focus on how lifelong employability is affected by digitalization of work in a more comprehensive way.   
        new ways of career development taking the opportunities and challenges of digitalization in the workplace into account need to be investigated.  
  
        * The track will study the impact of digitalization on careers and develop recommendations, guidelines and tools  
* 7. Digital Education  
    * **Vision:** enable cost-effective deployment of digital tools in all aspects of university education  
          
        Paperless learning  
          
        Gap: From overall visions (e.g. optimal Human-Computer Interaction) to practical excellent, innovative and feasible realisations   
          
        Benefits and new possibilities with paperless education and assessment  
        Which human factors must be taken into account and what is the impact  
  
        * What would be a more concrete target?  
* 8. Digital Knowledge, Societal Transformation and Sustainable Development  
    * Maximizing digital knowledge to reach the Sustainable Development Goals  
          
        Maximizing digital knowledge to reach the Sustainable Development Goals  
        Focus on the societal consequences of digitalization and processes of human-computer interactions   
          
        The social distribution of (the access to) digital knowledge from a within-country, cross-country and North-South perspective is under-researched   
          
        What is the relevance of disparities and social inequality in the access to digital information?   
        Which forms and processes of digital knowledge transfer promote the empowerment of civil society and how can they be implemented?  
  
        * Reference to UN Sustainable Development Goals Agenda 2030  
            Link: [un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/][1]  
  
        * What concrete outcomes are envisioned? The research plan focuses mainly on studies, it seems. Are guidelines and recommendations expected as a result?  
  
## Openness & Privacy  
  
* 9. Copyright in the Digital Age  
    * **Vision:** sensible copyright laws for digital goods  
          
        Understanding digitalization of cultural goods  
        How should copyright law deal with the ongoing dematerialization of copyright works  
        How should copyright law be changed to accommodate new cultural practices in the digital world, such as mashups or remixes?  
        To what extent should copyright law be reformed to promote open access to protected works, in particular in the context of publicly funded research  
        "A goal of the project is to assist law-makers in devising sensible and modern copyright policies"  
  
        * "A  goal of the project is to assist law-makers in devising sensible and modern copyright policies"  
        * Is there some broader, long-term vision?  
* 10. Factors and Properties of Sustainable Digital Artifacts  
    * **Vision:** digital artifacts continue to be accessible and usable for hundreds or even thousands of years  
          
        Creating and using digital artifacts  
        The longtime persistence and use of generated digital artefacts is endangered for several reasons.  
        Even worse, the term digital sustainability has not yet been fully elaborated.   
        Sustainability = "capacity to endure"  
  
        * Sustainability = "capacity to endure"  
* 11. Digitalization of Governments  
    * **Vision:** fully exploit digital means (social media, sensor etc) to support citizen-government collaboration, without compromising privacy concerns  
          
        Improving governments through digital technologies  
        There is a lot of conceptual research on government-citizen collaboration. However, empirical research is still missing at large.   
        Open research questions are how to efficiently (e.g., low energy consumption) collect sensor data, how fuse data and how to extract useful information for users from it (possibly using machine learning), how to maintain privacy for users.    
        How can government-citizen collaboration be optimized using new technologies? Which technological solutions are useful in the realms of government?  
  
        * "fully exploit" is fuzzy. What could be a visionary target?  
* 12. Open Justice versus Privacy  
    * **Vision:** apply data mining to court decisions and files to drive new legislation  
          
        Understanding the impact of digitalization in justice  
        There has been no research on data mining in published court decisions so far.  
        The proposed research project will likely be the first.   
        The main research questions are:   
        Where is the dividing line between Open Justice and Privacy?   
        What precautions should be taken to realize a sustainable cooperation between machines and human beings in the judiciary?   
        Is it necessary to have specific regulations?   
          
        The research depicted above will enable publications, summing up the results of the research, analysing where the balance between the contradictory positions can be found and proposing rules or guidelines and/or technical solutions for the future handling of open court files. If a need for new legislation or for a modification of the legislation is found, proposals (draft laws) will be made accordingly. There might furthermore be proposals of parts of a future (universal) charter of digital human rights.
