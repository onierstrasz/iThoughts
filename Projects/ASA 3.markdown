        * Most important/common questions?  
    * Detecting relevant questions from context  
        * What is a context?  
        * Detect context  
        * Correlate questions  
    * Analyzing software data  
        * Detecting outliers and trends  
        * Detecting semantic links  
            * between structured and unstructured data  
            * eg textual descriptions of issues and questions vs structured code  
        * Mapping developer questions to queries  
    * Presentation  
        * Relevant visualizations  
        * Feedback  
            * Ranking quality and relevance
