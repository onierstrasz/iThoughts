# Science and Tools for Software Evolution  
  
## Problem  
  
* tools treat change at low level  
    * use text editor  
    * change = lines of text  
* refactorings higher level  
    * not understood by versioning systems  
  
## Approach  
  
* program transformations  
    * 5 domains  
        * refactoring tools  
        * software product lines  
        * bug fixing  
        * test evolution  
        * improving security  
    * 5 activities  
        * define transformations by analyzing change  
        * automate transformations to apply and script changes  
        * develop tools to compose and manipulate transformations  
        * integrate with version control systems  
        * tools to infer HL transformations from LL changes
