# Kats PhD Defense  
  
## Appreciation  
  
* Workbench for developing DSLs  
    * Composable specifications and analyses  
    * general approach by program transformation  
    * including testing  
    * convincing implementatin effor  
  
## Questions  
  
* Ch 1 Research Questions  
    * Seem rather technical than scientific  
    * What is the scientific goal of the thesis?  
    * What is the main scientific result?  
* Ch 2 Compilation by normalization  
    * No discussion of performance or expressiveness?  
    * relation to TXL?  
* Ch 3  Aspect weaving  
    * How does aspect weaving compare to dependency injection to adapt software systems to different platforms?  
    * How stable are point cuts wrt evolution?  
    * How does AOP compare with other extension mechanisms? (class extensions, traits, reflection)  
* Ch 4 Spoofax  
    * How much of this is claimed as an original contribution, and how much is "inherited" from Stratego?  
    * What is the key insight?!  
* Ch 5 - Evaluating attribute grammars with decorators  
    * Are decorators only useful for simplifying copy rules?!  
    * Aren't decorators part of Stratego?  
* Ch 8 Testing.  
    * Black box testing attempts to cover the interface (rather than the implementation) of a component. How is black-box testing supported?  
    * What constitutes good test coverage?  
    * What constitutes validation?
