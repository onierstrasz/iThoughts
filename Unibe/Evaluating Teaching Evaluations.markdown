                * Also if the students fulfilled their part!  
            * Clear regress to  
                * ECTS requirements (preparation for lecture and followup work)  
                * learning outcomes (long term, not just for exam)

    * How to get feedback over improvements of teaching evaluations?  
        * Compare lecturer and student views  
  
## Goals  
  
* research is rewarded, not teaching  
    * little incentive to improve teaching  
* "customer evaluation" is problematic in domains where mainy fail (eg 30-40%)  
* Goal of teaching evaluations (should be) to improve content  
    * Moving towards assessment and tool for resource distribution  
    * If used for assessment, lecturers will evaluate only stable courses  
  
## Forms  
  
* Too many questions  
* Some questions not relevant/meaningful  
    * "Useful for future career" (how can they know?)  
    * "Too difficult"  
* Most results are not actionable  
    * Comment section is the most useful  
* * What does it make sense to measure?  
* * What questions are students competent to answer?  
* Separate points for Faculty, Institute/Studienleitung, and Institute/Lecturer  
* A web version should be fillable over a period of time  
    * Interactive  
  
## Procedure  
  
* Does it make sense to evaluate Lecturers close to retirement?  
* Perhaps evaluate all courses, but only every 2-3 years  
* Asst profs can choose which are relevant for promotion  
  
## Followup  
  
* Negative evaluations should be discussed  
* Positive ones should be promoted
