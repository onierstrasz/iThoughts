Erik, Mircea, Carl, Oscar  
  
## Problems  
  
* Getting the big picture  
    * Who uses which data  
    * who uses which code  
* Not reprogramming the same thing  
    * hard to find out what is where  
* Need to track both calls and includes  
    * includes are used to include both declarations and definitions  
  
## Tool  
  
* glamour browser on top of moose  
* select subdomain  
    * displays subdomains as squares  
    * modules within subdomains  
        * arranged as treemap  
            * â€¦  
        * colored by function points  
    * dependencies between subdomains  
  
## Novelty  
  
* can answer questions about a large, complete code base
