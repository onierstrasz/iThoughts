FASE 2016 Invited Keynote

## Challenges  
  
* Gap between Models and Code  
    * Architecture is not in the Code  
    * Language Soup  
        * Too many DSLs  
    * Rethinking OOP  
        * More DSLs is not a solution  
        * OO : programming is modeling  
            * Exploit better explicit models in code  
            * Make it easier to encode knowledge in code  
                * Annotations  
        * Linking DK to SW artifacts  
        * eg Dicto  
* Developers spend most of their time reading code  
    * IDEs are glorified text editors  
    * Developers need specialized analysis tools  
    * Moldable Tools  
        * Core functionality  
            * Querying  
            * Browsing  
            * Debugging  
        * Cheap  
            * Should be easy to build DS tools  
        * Make domain concepts explicit  
            * link to tools  
        * eg Moldable Debugger  
* PLs assume the world is closed and frozen  
    * Static/dynamic divide  
    * Requirements are done  
    * Types are fixed and unchanging  
    * Beyond Smalltalk  
        * Link Application and code  
            * eg Morphic and Seaside  
        * Contexts for Evolution  
            * eg Theseus  
        * Ecosystem integration
