# Prisma abstract  
  
## Problem  
  
* Need to adapt in advance  
* Need to adapt too much  
  
## Why is it important?  
  
* cost?  
* effort?  
* too static  
  
## One startling sentence  
  
* reflect as you go  
  
## how?  
  
* reify execution as sequence of events  
* start from some initial point  
* each adaptation triggers further ones  
* only adapt what is reached
