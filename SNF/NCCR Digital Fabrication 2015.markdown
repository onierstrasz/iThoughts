## Intro meeting  
  
Fritz Eisenbrand  
  
* FE: Main goal: get on track  
    * identify weakness and risks  
    * Panel has great power to dictate what should happen (can stop the project)  
    * Topics can be opened or closed  
* OB: going for fundamental paradigm change  
    * too early for results  
* GE: Missing common prototype  
    * No horizontal structure  
    * It seems not really interdisciplinary  
    * missing benefits for the human being  
* RD: too large  
    * focus is unclear  
    * need to "open new doors"  
        * ask the architects!  
* FE: program consists of free-standing towers  
    * missing connections  
* HK: project contains good proposal  
    * change the way to train architects  
* WM: is there a grand challenge?

    * GE: Would it make sense to have a common DSL for the whole project? (not BIM)  
        * JB: A single DSL does not make sense; but we should look for common opportunities

        * HK: No, that is dangerous  
        * Must have a vision up front  
        * NEST may end up as a hodge-podge  
* MR: Good ideas and results!  
    * NEST is not a grand challenge

        * Perhaps in Civil Eng  
* Teaching  
  
## Management

    * vision  
        * progress in digital building culture  
    * Method

            * emphasis on empirical material research at full architectural scale  
    * Research questions  
        * Depend on projects  
    * Research attitude  
        * Good architecture always incorporates the knowledge  of its making  
    * Research assumptions  
        * robots are versatile tools for bespoke fabrication  
        * need for digital additive assembly process  
            * waste-free  
        * programming offers a way  to design processes  
            * vs geometry  
* Do not want to police collaboration  
    * foster through common research  
* Discussion points  
    * Research subsections  
    * Principal investigator collaboration  
    * Common workspaces  
  
## Debriefing  
  
* Tech transfer is a bit vague  
    * Needs better specification  
    * Targets users?  
    * Need to get industry collaboration with revenue  
* Communications should be "louder"  
    * Strong online presence would be good  
    * Report fell flat  
        * Missing narrative!  
    * Missing opportunities for advertising gender equality  
        * cf MUST web site  
* MSc program very narrow  
    * Just one dept  
    * Should reflect interdisciplinary domain  
    * MB: What's new is digital assembly  
* We want to see demos of collaborative research results!
