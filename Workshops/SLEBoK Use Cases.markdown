# SLEBoK Use Cases  
  
## Language Designer  
  
* Disambiguation in language definitions (PM)  
    * Research? Or does best practice exist?  
    * Scannerless parsers ...  
    * Reengineering  
* Coming up with the right language definition (BC)  
    * To ensure that it supports the right abstractions for application building  
    * Language definition process (Jordi Cabot's Colaboro)  
* To ensure the right services to manipulate the right abstractions (BC)  
    * E.g., You have a nice DSL; you want to step through the domain abstractions, not the generated code  
    * Moldable debugger, inspector etc  
* Help domain experts to encode their domain  
    * E.g., give a financial expert a high level DSL  
    * DSL design  
* Language / tool / application instance co-evolution  
    * Co-evolution research  
* Defining software quality metrics for language definitions  
    * Ease-of-use, expressiveness, abstraction  
    * Language design guidelines and heuristics  
  
## Tool designer  
  
* How to architect a language tool suite?  
    * Use a meta-language to define the language and support the tools  
    * Software generation  
    * Plugin architectures etc  
        * Not specific to SLE, though  
    * LSP â€” Language Server Protocol to enable communication between IDE and services  
        Link: [langserver.org/][1]  
  
* Is my type checker sound?  
    * Use Coq  
        * Not specific to SLE  
* Are my compiler and interpreter consistent?  
    * Randomized testing  
    * Bisimulation  
* Does my compiler respect the language definition?  
    * Verified compilers  
    * Test generation  
* Building a performant text editor  
    * Data structures, standard architecture  
  
## Forward engineer (joe programmer)  
  
* Develop code at a suitably high level of abstraction  
    * DSL technology  
  
## Domain expert  
  
* Express domain knowledge  
  
## Reverse engineer  
  
* Dealing with large legacy systems (TS)  
    * Techniques to parse, model and visualize old languages  
        * Rascal, Moose ...  
* I want to understand software written in a legacy language (no tools)  
    * Reverse engineering practices  
  
## Re-engineer  
  
* Migrate from one language to another  
* Clean up code
