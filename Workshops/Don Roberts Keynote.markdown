## First refactoring tool not used  
  
* List of refactorings  
* Ralph: "Build a Trojan Horse"  
    * To get you ideas out, put them inside a better tool  
* Eat your own dog food  
* Don't force people to leave their environment  
  
## Design of a refactoring tool  
  
* Must fit programmer workflow  
    * "I hate the refactoring menu in eclipse"  
        * Refactoring is what you do all the time  
        * Don't hide them in a menu  
* Good enough  
    * Fairly fast  
    * Fairly accurate  
    * When in doubt, ask the user  
        * Whenever the analysis is too hard  
* Get good salespeople  
    * Kent Beck was our first real customer  
    * Asked for new features  
        * Extract method even if it violates behavior preservation  
    * Evangelized refactoring  
* First class refactorings  
    * Treat them as nouns, not verbs  
    * "Inline method"  
        * Not really a good refactoring  
        * Extremely useful component in composite refactorings  
* Pattern matching  
    * Original refactorings as PO Smalltalk  
        * Unreadable mess  
    * Turned on pattern-matching extension  
        * Little-known extension  
        * Underscores  
        * Still not right  
    * We wrote our own Smalltalk parser  
        * Stream-based  
        * Stole backquote and @ from Lisp  
        * Enabled pattern matching language  
            * Kent: "It's like giving razor blades to babies"  
    * Rewrite tool  
        * "Screw behavior preservation"  
        * To use it, people need to understand ASTs  
        * Ask users to vet changes before they were applied  
            * Worked well if change sets were small  
  
## Projects  
  
* Framework upgrades  
    * "Software fossils"  
        * "I have 5 versions of Python to support all my legacy programs"  
    * Release refactoring sets together with framework upgrades  
    * Demo live upgrading HotDraw  
        * Code that cannot be migrated is highlighted in red  
* Layer replacement  
* Smacc  
    * Making generating parsers "easy"  
    * Simplify AST creation  
        * Avoid yacc boilerplate  
        * Automate AST node creation  
        * Generate traversals  
* Language migration  
    * "It's like translating Jabberwocky to French and German"

        * Is meaning preserved?  
        * "We're gonna migrate your system, bugs and all!"  
    * Project: Translate Delphi to C#  
        * 1.8 MLOC  
        * Translated over 18 months  
    * Built up a rule base of Smacc transformations  
        * Translate language constructs  
        * Add library transformations  
        * Iterate daily with development team  
        * Early transformations are generic  
            * Later add corner cases  
    * Jurgen: in our language migration projects we refactored also before and after  
        * Don: wasn't our problem  
        * John: our approach worked well because the languages are similar  
  
## Future?  
  
* Programmers still don't use refactorings  
* Refactorings still often unreliable  
* Programmers don't think in terms of transformations  
* Academics don't think in terms of programmers  
    * Jurgen: Not true  
* Still hard to write transformations
