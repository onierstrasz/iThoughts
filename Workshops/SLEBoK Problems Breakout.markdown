## Start with ...  
  
* Known problems from practice  
    * Dealing with large legacy systems (TS)  
        * Techniques to parse, model and visualize old languages  
            * Rascal, Moose ...  
    * Disambiguation in language definitions (PM)  
        * Research? Or does best practice exist?  
        * Scannerless parsers ...  
        * Reengineering  
    * Coming up with the right language definition (BC)  
        * To ensure that it supports the right abstractions for application building  
        * Language definition process (Jordi Cabot's Colaboro)  
    * To ensure the right services to manipulate the right abstractions (BC)  
        * E.g., You have a nice DSL; you want to step through the domain abstractions, not the generated code  
        * Moldable debugger, inspector etc  
    * Help domain experts to encode their domain  
        * E.g., give a financial expert a high level DSL  
        * DSL design  
* Artifacts  
    * Language definition  
    * Compiler tools  
    * IDE tools  
        * Building a performant text editor  
            * Data structures, standard architecture  
    * Analysis tools  
* SE topics  
    * Which aspects are different?  
        * The (implementation) languages used are different  
            * Not general purpose programming  
        * We adapt and apply SE principles  
    * Configuration management  
        * Language / tool / application instance co-evolution  
            * Co-evolution research  
    * Software quality  
        * Defining software quality metrics for language definitions  
            * Ease-of-use, expressiveness, abstraction  
            * Language design guidelines and heuristics  
    * Software architecture  
        * How to architect a language tool suite?  
            * Use a meta-language to define the language and support the tools  
            * Software generation  
            * Plugin architectures etc  
                * Not specific to SLE, though  
            * LSP â€” Language Server Protocol to enable communication between IDE and services  
                Link: [langserver.org/][1]  
  
    * V&V  
        * Reliable languages  
            * Is my type checker sound?  
                * Use Coq  
                    * Not specific to SLE  
            * Are my compiler and interpreter consistent?  
                * Randomized testing  
                * Bisimulation  
            * Does my compiler respect the language definition?  
                * Verified compilers  
                * Test generation  
* Stakeholders / roles  
    * Reverse engineer  
        * I want to understand software written in a legacy language (no tools)  
            * Reverse engineering practices  
    * Re-engineer  
        * Migrate from one language to another  
        * Clean up code  
    * Forward engineer (joe programmer)  
        * Develop code at a suitably high level of abstraction  
            * DSL technology  
    * Domain expert  
        * Express domain knowledge  
    * Language designer  
    * Language tool builder  
    * Teachers / instructors  
    * Students  
    * Product owner (moneybag)
