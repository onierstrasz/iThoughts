## Cool papers  
  
* Tobias Roehm and Walid Maalej use hidden Markov models to automatically detect developer activities from low-level actions. #ise2012 NIER  
* Evaluating the Specificity of Text Retrieval Queries to Support Software Engineering Tasks  
      
    Sonia Haiduc1, Gabriele Bavota2, Rocco Oliveto3, Andrian Marcus1, Andrea De Lucia2  
  
    * 88% Developer queries are "bad"  
        * Paper by BA Myers et al  
* James Corrigan wants to integrate mindful meditation, yoga nidra and journeying into the software process to improve attention. #icse2012 NIER  
* How Do Professional Developers Comprehend Software? (ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper) Tobias Roehm, Rebecca Tiarks, Rainer Koschke, and Walid Maalej (TU Munich, Germany; University of Bremen, Germany)  
    * Which Strategies, Sources and Tools do developers use to understand programs?  
        * Used think aloud field observations and semi structured interviews  
* Asking and Answering Questions about Unfamiliar APIs: An Exploratory Study  
      
    Ekwa Duala-Ekoko and Martin P. Robillard  
  
    * Question Abstraction Process  
        Sillito et al TSE 2008  
  
    * Nearly 400 recorded videos of developers trying to understand APIs  
        * simple problems of instantiating, composing and saving  
        * difficulty of abstracting from video to usable model  
            * abstracted as abstract action traces  
        * identified patterns  
            * some indidcate lack of progress  
    * Incoming dependencies, vocabulary mismatches and wring assumptions were the most common blockers  
    * Stylos and Myers hypothesis ICSE 2008  
        Incoming dependencies – problems getting to answer from initial type  
  
        * Google doesn't always have the answer  
  
## Demos  
  
* TraceLab: An Experimental Workbench for Equipping Researchers to Innovate, Synthesize, and Comparatively Evaluate Traceability Solutions  
    * graphical tool for composing solutions  
    * looks a lot like prograph  
  
## MSR  
  
* Alexander Breckel  
    * …
