# CUSO 2016 Winter School MT180 Feedback / Tips  
  
## Project your voice!  
  
* Speak clearly and deliberately  
* Don't be afraid of pauses  
    * Remember to breathe  
  
## Rehearse your presentation  
  
* Perform in front of a test audience  
* Simulate the target environment  
* Take the post mortem seriously  
* ... but don't over-rehearse!  
    * Don't read your speech  
    * Stay natural  
  
## What's the problem?  
  
* State your research question!  
    * Get to the point!  
    * Start with a concrete example or scenario!  
* Why is it important?  
* Why is it interesting?  
  
## What's your thesis?  
  
* What's the cool idea?  
    * Is it a "testable hypothesis"?  
* Is it science?  
    * Why isn't it "just" engineering?  
  
## Less is more!  
  
* Don't cram everything onto one slide  
* Avoid bullet points  
    * A talk is not a lecture  
    * 100 words on a slide is 95 too many  
* Use evocative examples  
* Focus on your take-home message
