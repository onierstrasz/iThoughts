    * proving correctness of whole based on properties of parts  
    * Principles and Dimensions  
        * Composing liveness properties is more difficult than composing safety properties  
        * Dimensions  
            * what is a component?  
                * concurrent / sequential  
                * (a)synchronous  
                * real-time  
                * static / dynamic creation  
            * what are the forms of compositions?  
                * sequential / parallel  
                * flat / hierarchical  
                * static / dynamic  
                * implicit / explicit (w operators)  
            * properties  
                * structural

                * assume-guarantee  
                * simulation  
    * Model checking and modular verification  
        * Components are finite Moore machines  
            * cf Kripke structures  
            * fairness assumption  
            * finite sets of inputs and outputs of propositional variables

    Arend Rensink  
    Compositionality, huh?  
  
    * Ingredients  
        * components, operators, parameters  
        * compositionally means that you can abstract from the parts and the composition and maintain equality  
            * so you can remain in the abstract domain  
    * Case 1  
        * bisimulation minimisation  
            * FSP example of lift and shaft composition  
            * composing LTSs yields product of states in worst case  
            * abstraction is weak bisimilarity  
            * minimize to equivalent LTS  
                * show in LTSA  
    * Case 2  
        * ND Choice over LTSs  
            * not compositional wrt weak bisimilarity  
            * tau.a ~ a but tau.a + b !~ a + b  
            * need rooted bisimilarity  
    * Intermezzo  
        * Congruence and compositionality are interchangeable concepts  
    * Case 3  
        * Action refinement  
            * atomic actions can be refined to more complex systems  
            * breaks abstraction function (more interleavings possible)  
    * Case 4  
        * Renaming in FSP  
            * breaks flattening of semantics into 1 LTS  
            * A = a -> a -> A  
                B = b -> b -> B  
                P1 = A||B  
                P3 = P1 {c/a} {c/b}  
  
    * Intermezzo  
        * Compositionality => Induction  
            * Prove: the sum of the first n odd numbers is a perfect square  
            * can't prove by induction wo strengthening the claim  
            * abstraction function is mapping to natural numbers  
        * So, compositionality is a generalized form of induction  
    * Case 5  
        * Model-based testing  
            * eg LTS models System Under Test  
            * derive test cases from model, not SUT  
            * Question: does conformance of components in LTS imply conformance of components in SUT?  
                * Do you still need to test the composition?  
    * Case 6  
        * Software Composition  
            * Put two student programs into eclipse and they won't compile  
                * naming conflicts  
            * Does composition of libraries work?  
                * version conflicts!  
                * "DLL hell"  
            * Resolve with namespaces  
                * Shri: these are bogus problems if you are willing to replicate the universe  
    * Case 7  
        * Error handling  
            * use an open universe of labels in LTS  
                * store useful information in the labels  
                * eg that errors occur  
    * Case 8  
        * Subclassing  
            * Java collections example where subclassing breaks  
                * Using LinkedList or HashMap as superclass changes semantics  
                * Type interface is not enough  
                * need richer abstraction  
    * Conclusion  
        * Compositionality requires:  
            * composition operator  
            * abstraction to properties of interest  
            * lifting to abstract level  
                * may involve weakening  
                    or augmenting the abstraction  
  
        * related to:  
            * (pre-)congruence  
            * induction  
            * disjoint union  
        * This framework does not fit all forms of compositionality ...  
  
## Tuesday  
  
* Computational Reasoning about OO Software Evolution  
    * Einar Johnsen  
        Link: [folk.uio.no/einarj/][2]  
          
        U Oslo  
  
    * focus on behavioral reasoning  
        * methods have contracts  
        * call sites also have pre and posts  
        * due to polymorphism don't know which method is invoked  
    * Easy to develop & maintain = hard to verify  
        * and vv  
        * Closed world verification  
            * complete proof system, no incremental development  
                * need to reverify after any change  
            * if a subclass changes the pre and post of methods, that changes the contract with clients  
                * invalidates old proofs  
        * Open world  
            * no complete proof system, incremental development  
            * simple implication between pre and post of super and subclass methods  
        * Behavioral subtyping  
            * super props hold in subclass  
        * Modular  
            * easier veriication, harder development & maintenance  
        * Incemental  
            * old proofs still hold  
        * Lazy behavioral Subtyping  
            * single, multiple inheitance  
    * Key idea: instead of making global proofs, keep track of proof context  
        * track what has been proved and what needs to be proved  
        * adaptations to class hierarchy change the proof context  
            * adding, modifying a class etc  
            * also common refactorings  
        * Kristen Nygaard: All irrelevant aspects of OO can be shown with restaurant examples  
    * Trait-based reasoning

            * Example new web site with ads coming from another server  
            * Windows Security model  
        * Web browsers contain many extension points  
            * Firefox plugins etc  
            * keep bowser smaller  
                * can alpha test new features  
            * extension points can conflict  
        * Overlays  
            * adding UI overlays to documents  
                * Sounds CSS-like  
            * overlays can conflict  
        * Modes  
            * privacy or "incognito" mode  
                * firefox and chrome  
                * Browser gives you sandboxed environment where nothing gets saved  
                * What does my FB page look like to other people?  
            * modes may interfere!

    * Example: conference management  
        * rules and constraints  
            * reviewer may not see other reviews before own review is submitted  
        * how to program?  
            * not if-then-else code!  
            * separate straight-line code from policies  
    * Policies  
        * does a policy satisfy a certain property?  
            * where do the properties come from?  
            * often tangled in encoding of rules  
        * Instead, just think in terms of policies and their relations?  
            * help w policy evolution ...  
            * eg refine policy to allow reading review only if not conflicted  
            * decompose policies into number of declarative assertions  
                * eg assigned(paper,reviewer), conflicted(paper,reviewer)

                    * LTL model checking  
                    * create a state machine (tableau) that represents the formula (assumption)  
                * weave aspect into tableau  
                    * prove the guarantee  
        * Interference can be analyzed for a library of aspects  
            * assumption of second aspect B might not be satisfied after weaving in first aspect A  
                * order might make a difference  
                * parallel weaving might not help  
            * example  
                * A encrypts messages w a password  
                * B adds allows possibility to remember password  
                * C backs up data over the network  
            * need to show incrementally that assumptions and guarantees match up ...  
        * Similar ideas can be used for complex event processing  
            * lots of commercial tools  
                * no semantics  
            * extend AspectJ with event detectors  
                * integrate response aspects that react by changing the stream of events  
                * event detectors are easy to analyze  
                * don't change the underlying system!
