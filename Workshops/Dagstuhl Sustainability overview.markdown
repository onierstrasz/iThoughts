# Sustainability research challenges overview  
  
Dagstuhl Sustainability overview  
  
## RC1: Artifact (and Metrics) Sustainability  
  
* Gap between domain knowledge and software artifacts make it hard to assess and ensure sustainability of the artifacts  
* How do we design sustainable artifacts? How do we measure sustainability?  
  
## RC8: Evolution / "How"  
  
* Over time, sustainability issues, policies and models evolve, causing their software implementations to become outdated.  
* How can we ensure that sustainability requirements and models can gracefully co-evolve with their software (and hardware) implementations?  
    * I.e., by use of suitable processes, software architectures, design patterns, model integration practices, and even machine learning techniques.  
  
## RC7: Reuse of Model Ecosystem Elements  
  
* Data collection and model construction for sustainability are highly resource-intensive  
* What kinds of strategies can be leveraged to facilitate the reuse of models, data, software architectures, etc. to lower the cost of making informed sustainability decisions?  
    * And make the artifacts themselves more sustainable?  
  
## RC2: High-dimension Heterogeneity  
  
* Many different models with different time scales, units, assumptions etc.  
* How to integrate, manage and query highly heterogeneous models to support decision making?  
  
## RC6: Decision and Learning Support / "What"  
  
* Sustainability issues are inherently complex, making it hard to provide decision-makers with the information they need.  
* What kind of modeling framework is needed to effectively support decision-making?  
  
## RC5: Trans-disciplinary / "What"  
  
* Diverse stakeholders speak different languages, leading to miscommunication and misunderstanding  
* How to elicit and model sustainability requirements in a transparent way, with a common vocabulary?  
  
## RC3: Uncertainty  
  
* Many sources of uncertainty.  
    * "Known unknowns" vs. "Unknown unknowns"  
    * Crosscuts everything!  
* How to capture, express, communicate and mitigate uncertainty in sustainability models and the underlying data?  
  
## RC4: Trust in Models  
  
* Sustainability models embody scientific theories that should be falsifiable, i.e., testable [Popper]  
    * Untestable theories do not inspire trust  
* How can we ensure that sustainability models are (easily) falsifiable?  
  
## RC9: Infrastructure / "How"  
  
* Sustainability models are inherently complex, and hard to understand  
* How can decision-making be better supported through interactive technology to explore what-if scenarios?  
    * E.g., Gamification, live modeling, AR/VR simulations, models@run.time etc.
