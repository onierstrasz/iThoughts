* innovation checks  
    * 7500 Fr for Academic partner

    * must be some technical risks  
        * else just service contract  
    * need metrics to demonstrate achievement of results

## ERC Advanced Grants  
  
Willy Zwaenepoel  
  
* established researchers  
    * > 12 years out of PhD  
* one call per year  
    * November submission  
    * results in July

    * pick your panel carefully!  
    * few CS proposals get accepted

    * You must write 2 different proposals!  
        * B1 should address non-experts  
        * B2 should convince experts too!  
        * Don't just write short and long versions!  
    * Don't give impression that you are doing more of the same thing

* proposal must have clear and well-defined goal  
* consortium is key  
    * be sure you know the people  
    * there must be a reason for a partner to be there  
    * need good project mgr and scientific mgt  
* process is fair  
    * knowing project officers does not help  
    * lobbying has little effect  
    * but random elements can cause problems  
        * reviewers are paid 450â‚¬ a day

        * only proposal text is considered  
        * past performance not considered  
    * 3 questions  
        * 1 scientific or tech excellence  
            * soundness  
            * progress wrt state of art  
            * Take care to explain to non-experts
