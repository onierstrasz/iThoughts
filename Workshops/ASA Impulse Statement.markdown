# Impulse Statement:  
  
Agile Software Assessment  
  
## Problems  
  
* Fact: Programmers spend more time reading than writing code  
* Architecture is lost  
    * Architecture is not explicit in the code  
    * Hard to extract from artifacts  
* Hard to track software evolution  
    * Relationships become disconnected  
    * Dependencies break over time  
        * Can't rebuild old versions  
* IDEs focus too much on programming and not on SE process  
    * IDE disconnected from run time and process  
    * Low level view of software impedes understanding  
    * Developers need means to perform specialized analyses  
* Need to bring together analysis and development  
  
## IDE directions  
  
* Bridge problem and solution domains  
    * Model-centric rather than model-driven development?  
* Maintain links between all SW artifacts  
    * Abandon file-based view of code?  
    * Also keep track of run time information  
    * Enable new kinds of analyses  
* Need meta-tooling environment  
    * Generate and maintain HL architectural views  
    * Tailor tools to analysis questions  
    * Implement mechanisms, not policies  
  
## Discussion  
  
* Need to integrate arch views  
* Do we need meta?  
* Too focused on solution not problem  
* Need to integrate domain models
