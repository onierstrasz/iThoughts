Manifesto for Dagstuhl 16252 Engineering Academic Software  
  
## Citation & Reviewing  
  
* I will properly cite software used to produce my research results.  
    * For each paper I submit, I will cite the software used to produce the research results. For each publication venue, I will look for guidelines on software citation. If I can't find them, I will ask the publisher for their guidelines. If they have none, I will suggest they sign up to the FORCE11 software principles.  
    * Need to explain what we mean by “properly”. Implies citing authors etc.  
    * Even if editors/publishers tell me not to.  
* When reviewing, I will require others to properly cite software used to produce research results.  
    * When I review scholarly works (papers, software, etc.), I will point out missing or poorly organized software citations.  
    * When I review a publication describing a software output, I will require a link to that software so I can test it.  
* I will actively encourage funding agencies to include software experts in their review processes.  
    * I will petition/encourage funding agencies to include software experts in the review process for projects/grants that propose to build or use a significant amount of software.  
    * I will volunteer to serve as a software expert in review processes.  
  
## Recognition  
  
* I will recognize software contributions in hiring and promotion within my institution.  
    * I will work within my institution to ensure that software contributions are acknowledged/exposed in job descriptions.  
    * I will endeavor to recognize and respect the contributions from software that enables or enhances the functionality of my projects.  
    * I will work to make my institutions tenure/promotion processes recognize/understand software contributions better.  
    * I will include my software activities in my CV and in activity reports, and ask where they should go if they are not present. I will discuss and highlight these contributions when reviewing CVs etc.  
* I will recognize software contributions at conferences by proposing dedicated sessions and prizes.  
    * I will propose sessions on software at conferences and support awards for software contributions.  
    * I will advocate recognition of the contributions software authors make to science by proposing sessions on software at conferences and meetings and by suggesting awards.  
  
## Making intellectual content visible  
  
* I will distinguish the intellectual contribution of my software from its service contribution.  
    * I will teach people that software has an intellectual contribution and help software authors distinguish their intellectual contribution from their service contribution.  
        * I will make an effort to recognize the positive outcomes, in terms of intellectual content, enabled by software projects that do not necessarily succeed or continue over time.  
        * I.e., intellectual contributions may consist of proofs of concept etc, not necessarily lots of users  
* I will publish the intellectual contributions of my research software.  
    * I will stimulate that research software engineers publish about their intellectual contributions in the relevant eScience / computer science / data science / computational science venues.  
* I will invite developers of software that enables research to be co-authors on papers about that research.  
    * I will make sure that research software engineers are co-authors on the papers which are derived from or enabled by the research software they contributed to.  
* I will publish how I organize and run my software projects.  
    * I will encourage publication about the organizations that are creating scientific software, including which tools they use, their methodologies, how they motivate participation, how they choose code review systems, etc.  
    * NB: formerly in “Other”  
  
## Software Projects  
  
* I will develop software in the open from the start, whenever possible.  
    * I will encourage software authors to release their software without judgement.  
    * I will not apologize for research software which is good but not perfect.  
        * Too negative?  
* I will acknowledge that reading and understanding source code is a legitimate part of the academic discussion.  
    * I will read, review and discuss the source code of the academic software that I am engaged with.  
        * I.e., take responsibility for it. NB: implies reviewing and understanding.  
* I will match proposed software engineering practices to the actual needs and resources of the project.  
    * I will consider the context in which software engineering "solutions" are applicable, and acknowledge that they are substantial investments for scientists.  
* I will help scientists improve the quality of their software without passing judgment.  
* I will document my academic software, including usage instructions, and input and output examples.  
    * I will make documentation a first-order priority, despite other time pressures, and make available hidden forms of documentation (e.g., long email threads explaining functionality, chat communication)  
        * What does this mean?  
        * We have to document first?!  
    * I will provide input examples, expected output, and the invocation that can be used to run my software as part of the documentation.  
    * I will understand what sort of project I'm working with/on. I will describe my software inputs, outputs, and my future plans for work around them, clearly and keep these descriptions updated. I will help others articulate this for their own projects.  
  
## Sustainability  
  
* I will contribute to sustaining software I use and rely on.  
    * I will make explicit my intentions to sustain (or not sustain) software I release.  
* I will package, release and archive versions of my software.  
    * I will be attentive to publish the software development I am contributing to in at least one sustainable and fully open access repository.  
    * Is the repo implicit in “package and release”?  
* I will make explicit how to cite my software.  
* I will consider and document the sustainability of my research software as thoroughly as its function.  
    * In developing research software, I will consider and evaluate its sustainability as thoroughly as its functional purpose.  
    * In details: refer to sustainability as an NFR  
    * I will evaluate and address the five dimensions of sustainability and address both the sustainability of the software and the sustainability of its community.  
  
## Removed content  
  
* Recognition  
    * I will encourage following best practices towards quality academic software so that the software artifact to be recognized can be both citable and more useful to others.  
        * Overlaps with best practice pledge earlier  
    * I will listen to the needs of software authors to better advocate for them.  
* Handbook  
    * I will encourage research/scientific teams developing software to refer to the handbook for guidance and provide feedback to improve the handbook.  
    * Career Paths I will build career paths for RSEs (e.g.)
