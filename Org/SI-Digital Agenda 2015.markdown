        * eg Uber  
* Better simulation and modeling  
* Attacks on privacy  
    * What is the advance?  
  
## Actions  
  
* Build broad foundation  
    * Teaching/training at all levels  
* Provide showcases and surprises  
* Maintain technology leadership  
    * Maintain and strengthen top research  
* Teach the teachers  
* Federal government as an example  
    * Buy services or prototypes from startups  
        * Instead of giving away “startup grants”  
* Gain leverage for SMEs  
    * Develop a program to connect SME with technical colleges  
  
## Questions  
  
* What are the challenges?  
* What is the economic impact?
