# What is Good Design?  
  
## Simplicity  
  
* Small methods  
    * Not overcrowded  
    * Easy to get an overview  
* Each method has its own responsibilities  
* Delegate responsibilities  
  
## Good documentation  
  
* Enough to understand  
    * Good balance of detail  
* Include UML design overview  
  
## Bugs  
  
* Bug-free  
    * "As bug-free as possible"  
* Robustness  
    * Works in spite of bugs  
  
## Testing  
  
* Test specific functionality  
* Have generic tests that work when you change the coded  
  
## Respect coding conventions  
  
* Well-formatted  
  
## Efficiency  
  
* Should solve tasks efficiently (performance)  
* No redundant code  
  
## Algorithms  
  
* Avoid recursive functions  
    * If it makes algorithms hard to understand  
  
## Interfaces  
  
* Exploit plug-compatibility  
* Encapsulation  
* Use interfaces and abstract classes (if you can)  
* Black box: talk to interfaces  
  
## DbC  
  
* Formulate pre- and post-conditions
