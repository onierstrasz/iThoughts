## Architecture  
  
* Big picture  
* Different styles in history  
* Technology is more important than in design  
* harder to change  
* how things fit together  
* constrains design  
* can be dictated by a framework  
    * example: Play framework  
    * may even hide details of the architecture from developers!  
* Examples  
    * Layered  
    * 3-tiered  
  
## Design  
  
* Team members can influence design, but not so much architecture  
* how things work inside
