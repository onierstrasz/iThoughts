## Discord feedback  
  
* KH  
    * (1) an overview of the main tools in GT  
    * (2) a good introduction to Spotter as the main door to exploration.  
* EH  
    * An introduction to BrAptitude .  
* Sepoy  
    * enabling a non-technical user to interact with your creation.  
        * specifically building forms, accepting input, (doing stuff)  
        * transitioning to the resulting view would be very insightful  
    * Moldability  
        * a high level of how moldable development becomes a reality with the various tools in Gt:  
            * Custom Views  
            * Custom Searches  
            * Custom editor stylers  
            * Etc. Basically the different ways to modify the system, which usually tie back to some type of annotation that begins with <gt...  
  
## Too advanced ...  
  
* Learn about visualization ?  
* Molding the IDE  
* Principles & Patterns?
