## Center  
  
* Need to be clear that there are no overlaps with ID, ILUB etc etc  
* SA (WISO) would be interested to make use of digital services  
    * Challenges in hosting, managing, cleaning, analyzing data  
    * SA: Interested in digital service support for research (eg programmers) [SS not explicitly planned]  
* SM (THEO) also interested in programming services  
* Vetsuisse has some interest for a Competence Center, related to bioinformatics and data  
* PhilHist A Competence Network/Center would be most welcome  
    * Programming is slowly becoming more important  
    * Data science, text mining, ML etc important for some research groups, especially linguistics  
    * Much is waiting for the Digital Humanities Prof.  
        * Focus most like on text mining and analysis  
* RW Would be interested to participate in a Center to take advantages of services  
    * Digital tools used in teaching (podcasts etc)  
        * Looking at digital exams  
    * Not much need for data management or analysis  
* PhilHum Also thinking about a competence network (!)  
    * Would be great to have a cross-faculty network  
  
## Summary Report  
  
* Single report summarizing our discussions within PhilNat and with other faculties.  
* RB: would be important in summary to make clear what is meant by "digitalization"  
  
## Digital skills  
  
* Digital skills important for NF students in Statistics (how to upload a PDF!)  
* Coordinate all the different introductory courses on programming, statistics etc (STATS has intro course on R)  
* NB needs programmers; PhD students and postdocs teach ad hoc courses  
    * Python and LabView  
    * Not known what needs in rest of DCB  
    * One sysadmin person for DCB  
* WISO (SA) needs Python training for researchers (PhD, postdoc, tech staff)  
* RB teach Python for biology students; also R; many students attend P1  
    * Courses in English important  
    * Also teaches command-line for dummies  
    * Need for linux intro course (digital skills)  
* KH Courses on basic code optimization skills would be welcome!  
    * KH code optimization is a particular skill that is missing; usually outsource this  
* UL: could benefit from basic courses on digital skills; many institutes doing it ad hoc  
* Programming currently is _not_ an issue for Vetsuisse students (!)  
    * Students only use pre-packaged data analysis packages or tools  
  
## Services  
  
* Web design  
    * Many groups could benefit from help, support or coaching in developing web site  
        * NB lacking standards for developing group web pages  
        * Mix of standard CMS and ad hoc pages  
* Security  
    * Data security is also an important theme  
    * Data security is an open issue for VetSuisse  
        * Open research data poses a problem due to sensitive data  
* Research support  
    * KH: ScITS research support could be stronger  
* Research Programming  
  
## Projects  
  
* Digital lab notebooks  
    * NB Digital inventories missing for chemical resources  
    * RB digital lab notebooks would be useful for this  
        * The OneHealth IRC is looking at this  
        * Look eg at openRDM.swiss project and openBIS  
            Link: [labnotebook.ch/index.php/openrdm-swiss/][1]  
  
        * Could have project to develop this (or adapt off the shelf products) [ask RB]  
* Course database  
    * Many institutes have their own database for courses; needs improvement (eg not all rooms listed)  
* Vetsuisse Clinic information systems are not compatible -- need better solution  
* Long-term research data storage  
    * Open data access  
        * NB only her group working with lots of data  
            * Storing data and making open access is an issue (TBs, not PBs)  
            * Meeting SNF requirements is an issue  
            * Repository infrastructure missing  
        * UL network could help with open access for data with SNF  
        * VRF is running workshops on Data Management Plans (same as Research Office?)  
  
## Liason  
  
* Research Office  
    * Coordinate with EUresearch -- what could CND do to support research proposals and activities? [sent email to Rolf Klappert]  
* ID  
    * Coordinate with ID -- what kind of infrastructure needed?  
        * Could also negotiate with ID about data storage (why costs so high?)  
        * ubelix  
            * KH also with clusters -- would be cheaper if enough players would participate  
                * Hard to convince groups to move to ubelix  
            * KH decision making between ScITS and ubelix group needs to be streamlined  
* BORIS  
    * RB: Most publication are already in PubMed  
    * RB Sees various possibilities for improvements; usability is poor  
    * Tosso Leeb plans to contact BORIS team  
    * Could have project to gather requirements  
* VRQ  
    * Steering of digital strategy  
* VRE  
    * Continuing education  
* VRL  
    * Digital skills with SwissUniversities  
        * ILUB — Hansjörg Lauener  
        * 500K available?  
* VRF  
    * SNF Data management plans  
* Uni App Steering Committee  
    * Verwaltungsdirektor Markus Brönnimann  
    * ID Urs von Lerber

        * Would like to see a collaborative group on GPU programming for HPC  
    * Simon Grimm is the expert in GPU programming and hardware, and would need permanent funding  
        * funded from StratA project to participate in ubelix group  
* ML and statistics  
    * KH: close ties to ARTOG and ISP; developing a network on ML and statistics  
* E-learning  
    * VetSuisse has already established e-learning strategy  
        * All exams already digital, on dedicated laptops from IQL  
        * Podcasts widely used  
* Phil Hum Technologieplattform  
    * SS: Prof. Hossner in Phil Hum manages shared programming positions supported by UL  
    * PhilHum Has "Technologieplattform" -- couple of IT experts to support projects  
  
## CND organization  
  
* Check statutes of Oeschger Center  
    * need concept of “associated” research group that offers certain skills (eg groups of Lutz, Johanna and David Ginsbourger)

    * JZ will ask if STATS wants to be on the board  
    * CT and KH agree to be Board members
