Embracing Software Variability to build Explainable Systems  
  
## Explainable Systems  
  
* Running system  
    * Can only see GUI interactions  
    * Running Ludo Game  
* Source code  
    * Can only see static source  
    * Ludo source code  
* Tests  
    * Only useful if they fail  
    * Ludo tests  
        * Just show examples running  
* Explainable system  
    * Explore and query  
    * …  
  
## Example  
  
* Ludo game  
    * Multiple views  
    * Examples of questions to answer  
        * ...  
* Want examples for searches and actions  
  
## Variability in Moldable Tools  
  
* Inspector  
    * Views, Actions, Searches  
* Coder  
    * Views  
* Lepiter  
    * Annotations  
    * Snippets  
        * Refactoring  
        * Python  
* Debugger  
    * Exceptions  
  
## Birds-eye view  
  
* Plugins, but dynamic  
    * Objects bring their custom extensions  
* Fine-grained  
    * Most tools are tiny  
* Compositional  
    * Navigate flow of objects  
  
## Conclusion?
