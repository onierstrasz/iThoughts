# Teaching Moldable Development  
  
Proposal for ESUG 2023  
  
## MD Best Practice Patterns  
  
cf Kent Beck's book  
  
* Learn to find stuff  
      
    Maybe a set of patterns?  
  
    * Tools  
        * MethodFinder  
        * Spotter  
        * Metaprogramming  
        * Coder  
            * References  
            * Examples map  
            * Class/method spotter  
        * Filters  
        * Senders, Implementors ...  
        * Driller  
        * Examples  
    * _Check the video script_  
        * Also create How to pages  
    * What are you looking for?  
        * Where is this implemented?  
        * How do I use this method/class?  
        * Is there a method that does this?  
* Prototype new behavior in an Inspector playground  
    * Start from a playground  
        * In a Lepiter code snippet  
        * In an inspector playground  
        * Any other playground  
            * They are everywhere!  
    * Write a live code snippet  
        * test it  
        * extract it as a method  
* From Test First to Example First  
    * Explore and play with the example  
        * Then extract it as a method  
        * Turn it into an example  
        * Add assertions  
        * Use it as a setup for further examples  
* Design screenshots to tell a story  
    * Show the exploration path  
        * Code snippet -> view  
* Start from a Lepiter page  
    * then start from a code snippet  
    * then work from inspector views  
* Moldable views  
    * Inspector views  
    * Actions  
    * Searches  
    * Advices  
* Replace navigation by view  
    * If you find yourself navigating, build a view  
    * example: slideshows  
        * navigating to the list of priorities  
            * Make a priorities view  
        * searching for the slide methods  
            * create a view with the methods in order  
    * Adjacent views  
        * Building views so you can explore a list next to the exploration view / analysis  
* If you find yourself executing the same code snippet, create a button  
    * gtActions  
  
## Onboarding Patterns  
  
* Mentoring  
    * Pairing  
  
## Other patterns  
  
* The Debugger is Your Friend  
    * The Inspector is Your Friend  
  
## Obstacles  
  
* GT is the first thing you see  
* GT is not as good as my hammer
